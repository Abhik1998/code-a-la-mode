      <span>The Game</span>
    </h2>
    <div class="statement-rules-content">
      <p>
        This is a three-player game played on a grid of size w*h. A match is played in 3 rounds, each with 2 of the players.
      </p>
      <p>
        Round 1: player A vs player B <br>
        Round 2: player A vs player C <br>
        Round 3: player B vs player C <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        Each player will thus play two rounds in each match. A player total points is the sum of both rounds' points.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each round lasts for <const>150</const> turns and plays the same kitchen and customers conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>A round</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Both players control a chef who moves around the kitchen and prepare food for customers. Both players play collaboratively, and one after the other.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>The kitchen</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        The kitchen contains: floor cells (on which the chefs move), a bin, empty tables, a plate disposer and a customer window.
      </p>
      <p>
        It also contains different food crates that dispense either blueberries, ice cream, strawberries or dough.
      </p>
      <p>
        It also contains different appliances: a chopping board and an oven.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>The customers</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        At most 3 customers are waiting for their order. A customer's order can contain 2 to 4 desserts. Each validated order rewards the team of chefs with points, but the longer the customer waits, the less points they get.
      </p>
      <p>
        A customer's order should be served on a plate: <const>0 - plate</const>.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are maximum 3 plates in play. As soon as an order is validated, a new plate is made available in the disposer.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>The desserts</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        The chefs can prepare two basic desserts: <const>1 - blueberries</const>, <const>2 - ice cream</const>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The chefs can also prepare two intermediate desserts: <const>3 - strawberries</const>, and <const>4 - croissants</const>. Strawberries need to be cut at the chopping board before being dressed. A dough needs to be cooked into croissants at the oven before being dressed.
      </p>
      <p>
        The chefs can also prepare one advanced dessert: <const>5 - blueberry pie</const>. A dough need to be chopped at the chopping board, then mixed with blueberries and cooked into a blueberry pie in the oven before being dressed. Cooking takes <const>n?</const> turns.
      </p>
      <p>
        If food is not taken from the oven after <const>m?</const> turns, the food gets burned and must be thrown into the bin.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Actions</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        To move to a different cell, use the command <action>MOVE x y</action>. A chef moves horizontally and vertically, of <const>a?</const> cells at most.
      </p>
      <p>
        To pick up an ingredient from a crate or a table, use the command <action>USE x y</action>. If the chef is adjacent to the corresponding cell, the ingredient is picked up; else, the chef will move closer to that cell.
      </p>
      <p>
        To mix different types of food, a chef must use a plate. Hence, a chef can carry at most 1 type of food unless carrying a plate.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <action>USE x y</action> command also allows to put what the chef is carrying on a table (or drop it in the bin). The pick up action has precedence over the put down action.
      </p>
      <p>
        To chop food, use the `USE` command. The action will succeed only if the chef is carrying strawberries or a dough, with or without a plate.
      </p>
      <p>
        To cook the dough into croissants, use the `USE` command. The action will succeed only if the chef is carrying a dough, with or without a plate.
      </p>
      <p>
        To cook the dough into croissants or berry tart, use the `USE` command. The action will succeed only if <br>
        - the chef is carrying a dough and/or a plate in which case croissants will be cooked. <br>
        - the chef is carrying a chopped dough and blueberries in a plate in which case a berry tart will be cooked.
      </p>
      <p>
        To do nothing, use <action>WAIT</action>.
      </p>
